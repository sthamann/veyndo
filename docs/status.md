# Veyndo: current status

Updated 21 October 2026. Start here for the public product, observed journeys and
remaining delivery work. Source code, passing tests and a successful public
journey are tracked separately. All purchases below use **simulated payments**.

## What is online now

Core and Studio run merged main `7f0d4266`, image `offbeat-mind-8124`, deployed on
21 October at 22:47 CEST. Original Storyfront remains a separate service on
`cbb4d283`, image `alert-light-1076`. The final combined release in
[PR #191](https://github.com/sthamann/veyndo/pull/191) passed full required CI,
snapshot-backed migration, the public two-account company-purchase check and
the original embedded Storyfront purchase/return/empty-cart check.
The approver inbox and reopened orders now show their accepted app configuration.

The connected merchant workspace now supports these concrete journeys:

- Describe a collection task; prepare a native category, selected product changes,
  translations and a landing page in a private workspace; review and publish the
  chosen changes together.
- Create and configure an app, edit its records, preview privately and publish a
  selected package without publishing unrelated test data.
- Configure a desk with material and dimensions; save the selection, obtain an
  independent company approval and buy. Reorder at the current price while the
  original order retains its accepted configuration.
- Turn completed native work into an event-driven Flow draft with explicit input
  mapping, limits and a fresh personal review before execution.
- Compare a saved rule with an unsaved draft on recorded order-placement inputs,
  with the same native interpreter and no changes to existing orders.

## Public acceptance

| Journey | What was observed | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Collection preparation and selected publication | The configured model prepared five connected steps for two selected products. The same task resumed without duplicating its category. Reviewed Italian translations and the landing page were published together; a EUR 49.90 purchase retained the Italian product name. | [Collection and release history](evidence/release-history-through-2026-10-21.md#21-october-connected-collection-preparation-runs-publicly) |
| Personal workspace and generated app | Current editor context, saved private guidance, editable product filters, two approved native category steps, reload continuation and a generated English/German care-note app with retained records and central settings. | [Workspace browser evidence](evidence/agentic-workspace-2026-10-20.md) |
| Configured company purchase and reorder | First order `RAC-f117d21d`: Walnut Select, 260 × 80 cm, EUR 78 surcharge, EUR 427 total. After a material change, saved-list reorder used Walnut Select Plus, EUR 98 surcharge and EUR 447 total. The final all-browser repetition `RAC-34c09fc1` used separately signed-in buyer/approver sessions; approval and reopened orders displayed those exact values. Return/reload retained an empty cart; the original order still shows its older material and price. | [Public steps and screenshots](evidence/furniture-browser-2026-10-21.md#public-two-account-browser-acceptance-after-the-combined-release) |
| Repeat completed work | A completed task opened as an inactive Flow draft. After explicit activation, one real product update prepared a fresh review; approval created exactly one hidden native category. Completion survived reload and the category stayed private. The test Flow is inactive again. | [Flow browser evidence](evidence/flow-native-work-2026-10-21.md#reusing-completed-work-public-acceptance) |
| Compare recorded rule cases | A EUR 49.90 frozen case did not match the saved EUR 100 threshold and did match the draft EUR 1 threshold. Editing cleared stale results; reload retained the saved revision and unchanged order count. Desktop and 390 × 844 mobile Studio passed. This is condition comparison, not complete historical checkout repricing. | [Rule comparison](rule-history-comparison.md) |
| Repair missing product content | The assistant identified missing German text/media on one selected private product. A scoped translation was reviewed and applied; price and stock stayed unchanged. No completed image-generation claim. | [Product gap evidence](evidence/product-gaps-2026-10-21.md) |
| Original Storyfront embedded checkout | On the final public runtime, the first iframe open loaded normally and `RAC-4a94c770` completed for EUR 59.90 with a German lamp name and EUR 9.56 VAT. Receipt return and full reload retained an empty original bag. No retry or separate checkout navigation. An exhausted cup fixture was correctly rejected before this purchase. Earlier extension-controlled tabs had paused/blank document loads. | [Final-release purchase and screenshots](evidence/storyfront-checkout-2026-10-21.md#final-combined-release-first-load-purchase-and-empty-cart-reload) |
| Native app extensions and workflows | Visual product fields, retained data on upgrade, native grid/filter integration, selected publication and distinct old/new order workflows were accepted publicly. | [Product fields](evidence/native-app-fields-hosted-2026-10-17.md), [app workflows](evidence/native-app-workflows-hosted-2026-10-17.md) |
| Inward agentic commerce | Native UCP transfer purchase, private Shopify variant intake, app declaration diagnostics and original embedded checkout passed. | [18 October acceptance](evidence/agentic-commerce-hosted-2026-10-18.md) |
| Native POS and documents | Fictional POS sale, native invoice/PDF and guarded app-bound completion passed on 17 October. Physical printers and real settlement were not part of that acceptance. | [Buyer/POS evidence](evidence/buyer-pos-hosted-2026-10-17.md), [PDF follow-up](evidence/receipt-pdf-hosted-2026-10-17.md) |
| Browser entry and retained sessions | Public Google and password sign-in, reload and logout passed on 16 October, alongside new SaaS creation and its single-use Studio handoff. Apple still requires its Service ID callback correction. | [Browser session contract](browser-sessions.md), [historical observations](evidence/release-history-through-2026-10-21.md#public-acceptance) |

## App system and architecture

| Area | Implemented foundation | Remaining boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| App storage | Shared bounded records, references, indexes, settings and immutable packages; four fixed physical tables replace per-app physical tables. Public legacy-data migration was verified. | Capacity depends on measured workloads; shared storage is not a promise of unlimited throughput. [Storage model](app-data-storage.md) |
| Native object extensions | Versioned product/customer/order/company fields feed native details, grids, exact filters and permission-aware operations. Product lifecycle passed publicly; the other object types have local/CI coverage. | Broader arbitrary object types and every external protocol need their own contract and acceptance. [Extension contract](app-core-extensions.md) |
| Sandbox and app lifecycle | Private previews, current rights, version/digest checks and selected configuration publication use the same native owners. Material upgrades preserve historical orders. | Arbitrary Rust/TypeScript source compilation and hosting are not established by managed app packages. [App system status](app-system-status.md) |
| Agents and model tools | Durable checkpoints, leases, cancellation, reviewed native writes, distinct revocable identities, model allocation limits, emergency stop and OpenAI/Claude/Ollama tool protocols. | Real provider quality and invoiced cost are separate from fixtures and conservative allocations. [Controls](agent-authority-controls.md), [durable work](durable-agent-runs.md) |
| Authorization and database isolation | Current tenant/actor rights, separate restricted SQL roles, strict startup and native API/MCP operation checks. | Every new operation must retain those controls; an earlier audit is not whole-system certification. [Hosted database enforcement](evidence/database-enforcement-2026-10-15.json) |
| Events and workers | Separate cognition/apps/flows/audit checkpoints, durable traces, bounded workers, fenced retries and per-tenant admission. | Fleet throughput, failover and large-catalogue limits require representative measurement. [Rust service ownership](rust-services.md) |
| Contracts, boundaries and money | Generated operation input contracts, five real workspace libraries, exact money primitives and original PHP differential checks. | Response/domain DTOs and root-handler extraction remain incomplete; compatibility calculation paths still contain `f64`. [Hardening owners](platform-hardening.md) |
| Prompts and evidence | Versioned prompt files with IDs/digests; actual provider/admission and injection cases in the registered tests. | Passing admission checks does not establish semantic model quality for every merchant task. [Testing](testing.md) |

## What remains to finish

1. **Isolate the remaining controlled-browser iframe failures.** A fresh private
   session now completes first load, purchase, return and empty-cart reload with
   native browser input; a normal-window first-open countercheck also passes.
   Earlier extension-controlled tabs reported paused/blank
   documents on the same deployed code. Preserve both observations; the cause of
   those earlier pauses and a broader reliability rate are not yet established.
2. **Complete Apple login configuration.** The new `start.veyndo.ai` callback
   returns `invalid_request: Invalid web redirect url`. Apple Developer access is
   required to change the Service ID and perform the actual sign-in.
3. **Accept the separate hosted migration service.** The Rust application and
   five source protocol fixtures reach private native products, media, pages,
   customer/address records, history, reviews and coupons. Saved mapping/comparison
   and reviewed cutover controls exist. Hosted gateway/callback setup and one
   complete public source-to-purchase journey remain open. [Migration guide](agentic-migration.md)
4. **Accept external integrations at their real destination.** Vercel, Klaviyo,
   HubSpot, Contentful and Algolia apps, Shopware 6 inward product intake and
   existing Shopify/WooCommerce/Slack routes have local fixtures. Actual provider
   activation, Nexus execution and external Vercel checkout need their own
   recorded outcomes. [Integration guide](service-integrations.md)
5. **Measure remaining operational claims.** Real provider payment/mail/refund,
   a recorded restore drill, large-catalogue/multi-worker throughput, complete
   historical checkout repricing and isolated arbitrary-source builds are not
   established by the public demo journeys. Current payment testing deliberately
   remains simulated. [Ordered follow-ups](connected-merchant-followups.md)

A fresh native cart also asks for the privacy choice again. This was observed in
the public reorder test and remains a usability follow-up; no consent was inferred
or silently granted to hide it.

## Start testing

1. [Take the first shop tour](first-tour.md).
2. [Build and privately test an app](app-tutorials/README.md).
3. [Review and publish selected changes](workbench.md).
4. [Understand the shared architecture](production-architecture.md).

The [dated release history](evidence/release-history-through-2026-10-21.md) retains
older versions and their exact acceptance limits. Implementation notes belong in
[CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md), verification contracts in [Testing](testing.md), and
measured capacity in [Benchmarks](benchmarks.md).
